## 🎯 Post-Deployment Checklist

### Immediate Actions
- [ ] Visit https://github.com/dzp5103 to verify your profile

- [ ] Verify workflows are listed and can run

### Optional Enhancements
- [ ] Add WakaTime token for coding statistics
- [ ] Customize the snake animation colors

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If Git Commands Fail
1. Ensure you're in the correct directory: `/workspaces/dzp5103`
2. Check if you have proper Git configuration:
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
   ```

### If GitHub Actions Don't Work
1. Check repository permissions in Settings > Actions
2. Verify secrets are properly configured for WakaTime integration
3. Ensure the repository is public for profile README to display

### If Profile Doesn't Display
1. Repository must be named exactly like your username (dzp5103/dzp5103)
2. Repository must be public
3. README.md must be in the root directory

## 🎉 Success Indicators

Your profile is successfully deployed when you see:
- ✅ Animated typing header at the top
- ✅ Tech stack badges displaying correctly
- ✅ GitHub stats cards showing your data
- ✅ Contribution graphs and streak stats
- ✅ Professional layout with Tokyo Night theme

## 📞 Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Push the code to GitHub using the steps above
2. **Within 24 hours**: Check that automated workflows are running
3. **Ongoing**: Keep your profile updated with new projects and skills
